                    <p>Mischief Ventured is an ongoing start up project that I am currently a part of. The aim of the project is to lower the barrier for entry into Hollywood with a social netowork for entertainment professionals that would allow interaction between them. Currently it's aimed at screenwriters, enabling them to sell their scripts directly to people who would want to bid on them. For this I am the UX Designer, Project Manager and am part of the Front End Development team</p>

                    <p>When I joined the project, quite a it of work was already underway and fairly detailed mockups of the proposed finished product already existed so I felt that it was important to get together a general style guide so everyone on the Front End team could be on the same page.</p>
